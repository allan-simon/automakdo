automakdo
=========

A small, extensible python script to automatically order macdonal online in China (admitting you already have an account)


you need to add a secret.py file,  which simply need to contains this 


    #DO NOT COMMIT THIS
    USERNAME = "your_user_email@address.com"
    PASSWORD = "your_password"

to avoid commiting by error your password, secret.py is set in the .gitignore


you need python3 to run this script, after simply do

    ./order.py 

and you're done 

the script is not very complete and lacks a LOT of menu
it would be nice if you extend it to send me back your modification
but it's up to you.
